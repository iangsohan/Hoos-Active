# HoosActive

This is our project for CS 3240 - Hoos Active

Checkout our website [here](https://hoos-active.herokuapp.com). [No longer operational]

Our website aims to encourage users to exercise and self-report exercise through features that promote friendly competition with other users. Upon logging in, users can access all of HoosActive's features once an email has been confirmed and a profile has successfully been created.

## Home Screen
On the home screen, users can use the "Add Exercise" feature to add information about a recent workout to their profile by selecting the exercise type, duration, timestamp, and the calories burned. This exercise is self-reported and will be added to a leaderboard for other users to see. Users can also use the "Schedule Workout" feature on the home screen to schedule different types of workouts for themselves.

## Profile
On the profile page, users can input and display their stats such as picture, age, height, weight, and location. All information can be edited by going to "Settings" and choosing "Change Profile Picture", "Edit Profile Information", or "Change Password". The profile page also displays a graph showing users their calories burned per day during a weeks span. The "Add Exercise" and "Schedule Workout" features are also available on this page. Users can also use this page to access their friends page.

## Friends Page
On the friends page, users can view their current friends, view their current friend requests, or search for users. When an existing user is searched for, that user's profile is brought up with the option to send a friend request. Having a friends list will further emphasize a sense of community on the website so that users can compete and encourage each other. 

## Leaderboard
On the leaderboard page, users view a leaderboard that displays top users' names, location, calories burned, and duration for the particular exercise that users can select to view. This leaderboard can be sorted by a bunch of different options such as by calories burned, total hours, or by the timeframe. Users can also choose to filter the leaderboard to either view all users or only users from their friends list.
